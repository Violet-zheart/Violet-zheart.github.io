Spam messages are growing fast in recent years, and they can be risky. So, detecting them is important. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods.We test different classifiers. We also use Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to fix class imbalance.\nWe evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. Naïve Bayes with TF-IDF (unigram + bigram + trigram) works best. We also build a live demo to show how the model detects spam in real time.\n\n\nData Overview\n\n\n\nKey Variables and Description\n\n\n\n\nWord Cloud\n\n\n\nSpam Word Cloud\n\n\n\n\nTopic Words in Spam Message\n\n\n\nTop 10 words in spam messages\n\n\n\n\nFinal Model\n\n\n\nFinal Model selection\n\n\n\n\nFor more detail information, please go to “projectcode” button to check.\n\n\nThank You!!"
