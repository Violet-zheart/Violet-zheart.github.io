# Introduction

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam). Spam messages are growing fast in recent years, and they can be risky. So, detecting them is important. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods.We test different classifiers. We also use Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to fix class imbalance.

We evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. Na√Øve Bayes with TF-IDF and N-gram models(unigram + bigram + trigram) works best. We also build a live demo to show how the model detects spam in real time.(in project code)
