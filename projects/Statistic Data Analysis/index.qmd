# Introduction

We've all experienced love, and human behavior towards love is often far more complex than that of other animals. One of the most notable behaviors is kissing. Humans tend to kiss when they are in love, which is not commonly seen in the behavior of other animals. This raises the question: why do people kiss? It's not just for procreation or the fulfillment of desires but also for forming a deep connection with others, especially in close relationships. In what situations do people tend to kiss more in their relationships? Does the surrounding environment aLect kissing behavior? What kinds of relationships encourage more frequent kisses? We explored the relationship between "Kiss Frequency" and various other factors within romantic relationships, such as the attractiveness of a partner, satisfaction with the kiss, and even some economic metrics including national GDP and the GINI index, which will be discussed in the section 3. We believe that there is complexity in this issue because having evidence to prove that at a country level there is a correlation is something that is not really focused on and was something we did not have much knowledge about before we started this analysis project. By examining these factors, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of how both personal and societal influences shape kissing behavior in romantic relationships. These findings will be explored in detail in the subsequent sections of this report.
